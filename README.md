# Selenium Automation Framework-Datadriven

[![N|Solid](http://www.seleniumhq.org/images/selenium-logo.png)](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) 

**This is a Selenium DataDriven Framework. Now no worry about to download and keep browser binary driver (geckoDriver.exe and chromedriver) on class-path as it will take care by **webdrivermanager** so no worry about compatibility issues between selenium and browser compatibility. You have to just keep selenium dependency  and browser on latest version.**

 **NOTE :**

For browser browser_binaries, the WebDriverManager keeps downloading the latest version of binary of the chosen browser so it is better to make sure or re-assure from time to time that the Selenium API version works fine with the browser. Otherwise, an upgrade is necessary. Reason is, we need to keep to our browsers updated to latest so a latest version of Selenium API is a must (if it's proven stable).
